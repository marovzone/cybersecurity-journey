# **🧠 Who I Am and Why This Channel Exists**

In short - my name is **Lesha**. I’m 37 years old.
A bit longer - I’m someone from IT who has **been inside systems for a long time**, not just around them.
This post exists to **explain who I am, where I come from, and where I’m going**.
You can read it out of order.
You can skim it.
You can come back later.

## **🕰 A Bit About the Path and Experience**

I’ve been in IT for **over 20 years** - with different depth, different responsibilities, and different focus.

Over this time, I’ve gone through:
- curiosity
- burnout
- growth
- role changes
- returning to the fundamentals

And now I’m once again assembling everything into a single, coherent system.

## **🖥 System Administration**

I’ve worked as a system administrator for **around 4 years in total**
(including the last six months - again, deeply and consciously).

During this time, I have:
- administered workstations and servers
- worked with Windows / Linux
- configured networks, access control, backups, virtualization
- dealt with what _actually breaks in real life_, not in textbooks
- Printers 😂 - can’t escape those either

But for me, system administration is not just “fixing printers.”

#### **🖥 Most Recent Role: System Administration in a Production Environment**

Most recently, I worked as a system administrator at a **food industry manufacturing facility** - a meat production plant.

This is not an “office with laptops,” but a **live industrial environment**, where IT is part of the technological chain, and any mistake has real consequences.
##### **⚙️ Infrastructure and Responsibilities**

Areas under my responsibility included:
- server infrastructure
- virtualization (hosts, virtual machines, role isolation)
- backup and recovery
- file services, access control, permissions
- support and development of the existing architecture
- video surveillance
- access control systems (ACS)

Linux was used **selectively**, but purposefully - for specific services and tasks.
Most of the infrastructure was application-driven and production-oriented, without “lab-level cleanliness,” which made the experience especially valuable.
##### **🧠 Environment Specifics**

The key challenge was **specialized equipment**:
- industrial scales
- production terminals
- specialized accounting and control devices
- integration of IT systems with real production processes

Here, you can’t just “reboot and see what happens.”
You need to **understand context**, chains, dependencies, and consequences.

#### **🤝 People and Atmosphere**

I want to say a few words about the team.
These are **very warm, alive, and kind people**.
Open, communicative, genuine.
That rare atmosphere where you’re valued not only as a specialist, but as a human being.
And it was here that I met **my other half**, whom I love deeply 🤍
Sometimes **her voice will appear in my projects and videos** - only her voice.
Like a warm presence nearby.

---
#### **📌 What This Experience Gave Me**

This stage gave me:
- real industrial experience
- an understanding of infrastructure outside “ideal conditions”
- confidence working with servers, virtualization, and backups
- and something very important - human support

It was an **honest and meaningful stage of the journey**.
It taught me **how infrastructure actually lives**.

### **💻 Web Development: Freelance, Business, and Responsibility**

Web development is a large and important part of my path.
In total - **over 8 years of active development**.
#### **🧑‍💻 Freelance and Early Stage**

For a significant period, I worked **as a freelancer**:
- websites
- services
- enhancements
- maintenance
- turnkey projects
  
This was a stage where you have to be everything at once:
developer, analyst, manager, tech support, and sometimes even a psychologist.
And this is where you very quickly develop an understanding of:
how **code affects business**,
and how **business breaks because of bad decisions**.

### **🏢 My Own Business and Web Studio (B2B)**

At some point, I launched **my own web studio**, focused not on individual clients, but on the **B2B segment**.

This included:
- corporate clients
- business systems
- internal services
- higher complexity, higher responsibility

Growth was **very fast**.
More projects, a growing team, increasingly complex tasks.
But just as quickly, everything **collapsed** -
due to management mistakes, which I may talk about separately one day.

It was painful, but an **extremely valuable experience**.

---
## **🧠 Roles and Responsibility**

At different times, I was:
- a developer
- a lead developer
- a team lead
- the person making architectural decisions

I’ve seen projects:
- that took off
- that stalled
- that failed because of processes, not code

---
#### **⚙️ Technologies and Stack**

Primary development language:
- **PHP** - as a base and foundation

Also worked with:
- **MERN stack**
- **Next.js** (partially, for specific tasks)

From an infrastructure perspective:
- databases
- web servers
- server-side logic
- deployment, environments, server interaction

I’ve never viewed development in isolation from infrastructure -
for me, it’s always **a single system**.

---
#### **🔐 Turning Toward Security and Low-Level Knowledge**

When I began to dive deeper into **information security**, my focus expanded.
I started systematically studying:
- **Bash** - for automation and understanding Linux environments
- **Python** - for scripting, analysis, and tooling
- **C** and **Assembly** - through intensive, deliberate study

Not for the sake of exotic skills,
but to **understand how everything works under the hood**.

---
#### **🧩 What This Experience Means to Me**

Web development gave me:
- systems thinking
- architectural understanding
- experience through mistakes and growth
- the ability to see a project as a whole

This experience now helps me go deeper into systems, networks, and security.

## **🧩 Interviews and the Current Stage**

Right now, I’m going through interviews with a company I **genuinely like**.

So far, I’ve passed:
- the HR stage
- the technical interview

The HR representative - **Oksana** - is a very warm, lively, positive person.

It’s easy to communicate with her, there’s humor, mutual positivity - and that’s something rare, which I truly value.

The technical interview was **challenging**.
Difficult at times.
At the edge at times.

But I was **moved forward** - and that matters to me.

---
## **🎯 The Next Step**

The next stage:

- an interview with the **CEO**
- an interview with the **company owner**

Two different people, two perspectives - but one interview process, and that genuinely interests me.

📅 **February 3**

🕑 **Start: 14:00**

After the interview, I will **definitely write here** about how it went.

---
## **🚀 Where I’m Really Going**

This whole story isn’t just about a job.
My bigger goal is **cybersecurity**.
Complex systems.
Large-scale challenges.
Real projects.

To get there, I need:
- deep networking experience
- a strong understanding of servers
- real infrastructure, not abstractions

And I’m moving toward it **step by step**.

---
## **📢 About This Channel**

For now, this channel is a **monologue**.

I will:
- share experience
- write honestly
- talk about what’s happening
- document the path

Over time, when there are more people and readiness for dialogue,
I’ll open discussions, questions, and communication.

---
## **▶️ More Is Coming**

There will be:
- a YouTube channel
- links
- other formats

All links will be published here.
For now - thank you for reading this far.
This is just the beginning.
